# Final Summary Notes

### Module 1

**Earth Science Literacy** - an understanding of the reciprocal relationship between Earth and human

**Scientific Method** - A systematic method of acquiring knowledge in the natural sciences through observation and experimental testing of hypotheses.

** Geology** - the study of Earth’s composition and structure, the processes that contribute to these and Earth’s history or time, going back to Earth’s origin.

**System** - An organized set of interconnected components that are defined by a definite boundary and work as a whole. The Earth is considered a system.

**Geologic Time** - The long period of time representing Earth’s geologic history.


##### Four subsystems

    - Lithification
        - Turning sediments back to rock
    - Metamorphism

- **Dyke** is more resistant to weathering

#### Magma
      
- **Magma** - melt - rich with low viscosity with <50% particles by volume with magma
    - Capable of intrusion and extrusion
    
#### Rock Classification

- Faster rate of crysallization above Earth's surface (alphatic texture)

- Slow rate of crystallization below Earth's surface (phaneritic texture)

##### Texture of Metaphoric rocks

- **Slaty Cleavage**
    - Rocks splits along parallel planes
    - Parallel alignment of many microscopic platy materials
    
    
- **Schistosity**
    - Platy minerals that are easily seen by the naked eye and are in parallel to sub-parallel alignment


- **Gneiss**
    - The rock contains visible banding of alternating layers of equigranular minerals that may include quartz or feldspar and platy materials

##### Quartz

- Hard (7)
- Conchoidal fracture
- Hexagonal crystal form

##### Feldspars

- 2 planes of cleavage at 90 degrees that form edges
- Opaque
- Relatively hard (6)
- Contains striations


##### Micas
- One plane of cleavage giving elastic sheets
- Soft (2-3)

### Module 3

- Geological time is determined base don rock sequences (stratigraphy) and calibrated in years using dating methods (geochronology)

- Current Epoch: Holoscene
- First appearance of reptiles: Paleozoic Era
- Age of reptiles: Mesozoic Era

### Module 4

- Fossil fuels are formed during the carboniferous period

##### Types of mineral deposits
- Igneous
- Metaphoric
- Sedimentary
- Residual or weathered

##### Process that concentrates the minerals
- Crystallization from agma
- Precipitation from hydrothermal or hot water solutions
- Concentration from lake water, seawater, flowing water in rivers
- Concentration from weathering

##### Category of Minerals

- Metallic vs. Non-metallic
    - Metallic
        - Contains metal
        - Igneous rocks
        - Ductile
        - Conductor of heat and electricity
        - Can be extracted by smelting
    - Non-metallic
        - Does not contain metal
        - No shine
        - Sedimentary rocks
        - Not ductile
     
           
- Aggregate
    - Non-metallic and nonrenewable
    - Used in construction
    
### Module 5

- **Modified Mercalli Intensity Scale** - earthquake intensity scale with 12 categories of ground shaking and structure damage

- **Moment Magnitude** - a numerical measure with 10 categories of the amount of energy released by an earthquake

- **Mass movement** - any type of downslope movement of earth's materials

### Module 6

**Stromatolite** - communities of microorganisms that baffle, trap, and precipitate particles into microbial mats in shallow water environment

- 3% fresh water, 2% locked in glaciers

#### Water
- causes rock to melt at lower temperatures
- bound within certain crystal structure of minerals
- contributes to concentration of minerals
- breaks down raw material
- initiates movement of materials
- destroys and builds landforms


- First water on Earth is created by outgassing

- **Biospheric Reservoir** - water stored in living organisms

- **Atmospheric Reservior** - Water stored in the atmosphere
    - Mostly in the troposphere
    
    
- **Geospheric Reservior** - water stored on Earth's surface and inside the Earth

#### Oceans

**Topography** - the relief of elevation of exposed continental land surface above a reference elevation or datum such as mean sea level in the ocean

**Bathymetry** - the depth of water below a reference elevation or datum such as mean sea level in the ocean

**Hypsographic Curve** - a plot of cumulative area on the Earth's surface that occurs at various elevations relative to 

- More water in Southern than Northern hemisphere

#### Rivers / Lakes

- Great lakes contains 20% of Earth's surface fresh water
- Waterloo is in the Lake Erie drainage basin

#### Ice / Snow

**Firn** - Granular re-crystallized snow
    - Transition period between snow and glacial ice

**Alpine glacier** - a mass of glacial ice in elevated terrain or mountains that descends down valleys

- Only two surviving ice sheet since last ice age: Greenland, Antarctica
    - Greenland ice sheets has thicker layers than Antarctica ice sheets (more details but less extent of time)
    
- Last glaciation happened during the Pleistocene epoch

- **Laurentide ice sheet** - the ice sheet that shaped Canada during the last ice age

**Moraine** - a landform or pile of sediment commonly composed of till deposited by a glacier

#### Soil

- **Hygroscopic water** - water tightly bound to the outer surface of soil particles that's not available for plant growth


- **Gravitational water** - water that exists in soil with large pores; drains quickly


- **Capillary water** - water that exists in soil with smaller pore
    - Accessible for plant growth
    
    
- Loam contains the most available water for plant growth
    - More clay => more hygroscopic water
    - More sand => more gravitational water
    - The key is to find a balance
    
#### Ground Water

**Aquitard** - a impermeable body of rock or sediment that hinders or prevents groundwater movement and cannot be extracted for use by humans

- **Moraines** in Southern Ontario filters the ground waters and helps the water to enter the subsurface
    - Also called **recharge areas**
