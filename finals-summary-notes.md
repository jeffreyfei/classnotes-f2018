# Final Summary Notes

### Module 1

**Earth Science Literacy** - an understanding of the reciprocal relationship between Earth and human

**Scientific Method** - A systematic method of acquiring knowledge in the natural sciences through observation and experimental testing of hypotheses.

** Geology** - the study of Earth’s composition and structure, the processes that contribute to these and Earth’s history or time, going back to Earth’s origin.

**System** - An organized set of interconnected components that are defined by a definite boundary and work as a whole. The Earth is considered a system.

**Geologic Time** - The long period of time representing Earth’s geologic history.


##### Four subsystems

- Atmosphere
- Hydrosphere
    - Cryosphere - study of ice
- Geosphere
    - Lithosphere - upper layer of earth
- Biosphere
    - Anthrosphere - study of humans
    - Asthenosphere - below lithosphere, flow as soft solid
    
### Module 2

**Silicates** - minerals consists of silicon and oxygen and bounded with additional minerals
    - Most abundant mineral in Earth's crust
    - **Ferromagnesium silicate** - darker in colour (biotite)
    - **Non-ferromagnesium silicate** - lighter in colour
    - **Feldspar**
    
- Other less abundant minerals


- Rock cycle components
    - Melting
    - Crystallization
    - Weathering
    - Lithification
        - Turning sediments back to rock
    - Metamorphism
        - Turning into metaphoric rock (from sedimentary or igneous)
        
- **Dyke** is more resistant to weathering

#### Magma
      
- **Magma** - melt - rich with low viscosity with <50% particles by volume with magma
    - Capable of intrusion and extrusion
    
#### Rock Classification

- Faster rate of crysallization above Earth's surface (alphatic texture)

- Slow rate of crystallization below Earth's surface (phaneritic texture)

##### Texture of Metaphoric rocks

- **Slaty Cleavage**
    - Rocks splits along parallel planes
    - Parallel alignment of many microscopic platy materials
    
    
- **Schistosity**
    - Platy minerals that are easily seen by the naked eye and are in parallel to sub-parallel alignment


- **Gneiss**
    - The rock contains visible banding of alternating layers of equigranular minerals that may include quartz or feldspar and platy materials

##### Quartz

- Hard (7)
- Conchoidal fracture
- Hexagonal crystal form

##### Feldspars

- 2 planes of cleavage at 90 degrees that form edges
- Opaque
- Relatively hard (6)
- Contains striations


##### Micas
- One plane of cleavage giving elastic sheets
- Soft (2-3)
