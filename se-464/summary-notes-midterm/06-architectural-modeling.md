### Architectural Modeling

- **Architectural model** - an artifact that captures some or all of the design decisions that comprise a system's architecture
    - The reification and documentation of the aforementioned design decisions is referred to as **architectural modeling**
    - **Architectural modeling notation** is a language or means of capturing design decisions
    
- Includes
    - Components
    - Connectors
    - Interfaces
    - Confugrations
    - Rationale
    
### Important Characteristics of Models
- **Ambiguity** - a model is ambiguous if it is open to more than one interpretation
- **Accuracy** - a model is accurate if it's correct or deviates within acceptable limits
- **Precision** - a model is precise if it is sharply exact or delimited

### Views

**Views** - subset-model
- Consistent if the design decisions they contain are compatible
- Inconsistent of two views contain design decision that are contradicting

**Viewpoint** - the concern (criteria)

### UML - Unified Modeling Language

**Static structure**
- Component diagrams
- Deployment diagrams
- Class diagrams

**Dynamic behaviour**
- Sequence diagram
- Use case diagram
- State machine diagrams

##### Advantages
- Support diverse array of viewpoints
- Ubiquity
- Extensive documentation

#### Disadvantages
- Needs customization through profiles to reduce ambiguity
- Difficult to asses consistency among views
- Difficult to capture foreign concepts or views
